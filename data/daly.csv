The corresponding daily conventions have been added. 

(The best solution I have found for connecting symptoms with daly adjustment is Matching the symptom with the most appropriate Health state (in Annex C) of WHO data

For hearing loss, it’s okay since there are many listed conversions (can be seen in the screenshot).

But for others, 
(1) Altered taste there is none (in this case maybe we could say it’s 0?),  Palpitations (I guess this could not be 0) etc
(2) With some I can associate with something that’s on the list eg “Muscle aches/weakness” or “Other injuries of muscle and tendon (includes sprains, strains, and dislocations other than shoulder, knee, or hip)” can be found in the list
